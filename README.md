## Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression
Pulmonary, meaning lung, and fibrosis, meaning scar tissue.Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lungs become scarred over time and The scarring of lung tissue makes it thick and stiff. As the lung tissue thickens, it becomes increasingly difficult for the body to transfer oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream. As a result, the brain and other organs may not receive enough oxygen. Scarring may also increase the risk of lung cancer.
## Symptoms 
Symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, feeling tired,weight loss,and nail clubbing.Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and lung cancer.

## Motivation
To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, review any exposure you've had to dusts, gases and chemicals,
and conduct a physical exam. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen carefully to your lungs while you breathe. He or she may also suggest one or more of the following tests such as Chest X-ray,Computerized tomography (CT) scan,Echocardiogram.but doctors arenâ€™t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum.**Till Now there is no Direct Diagnosis for the  Pulmonary Fibrosis** .

## DATA
